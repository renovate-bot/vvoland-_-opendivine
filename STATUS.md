# Status — how playable is OpenDivine?

**Short answer: not yet playable as a game.** You can walk a fully
rendered world with an animated hero, open doors and chests, and listen
to the menu music — but there are no monsters, no items you can pick
up, no stats, no story, and no saving.

This page tracks the *player experience*. The full engineering plan
with every implementation step is in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md); the
reverse-engineering knowledge base behind it is complete
([RE_STATUS.md](RE_STATUS.md)).

## Exploring the world

- [x] The whole world renders — terrain, decals, objects, with the
  original engine's depth sorting
- [x] Walk around: click-to-walk and WASD, camera follow, zoom
- [x] Walls and furniture block you (engine cube shapes + distance test; sliding along walls still approximate)
- [ ] Walking around obstacles automatically (pathfinding)
- [ ] Roofs hide when you step inside a building
- [ ] Day/night cycle (light tint, clock)
- [ ] Weather
- [ ] Map / minimap

## Your character

  combinations)

## Story & people

## Doors, chests & the interactive world

  chest contents yet)
